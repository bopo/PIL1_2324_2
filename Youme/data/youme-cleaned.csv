also seem to have the ability hold people's attention without even trying sometimes. noticing people who notice things around them.getting the trust of complete strangers. touching the soul of others. pushing the limits of creativity. my eyes or my hair.  i have very intense eyes that people say look right through things. the other thing is that sometimes i seem really tall. the intensity is what usually gets most people. my intensity is shown in just about all of me. i welcome your messages to tell me what you see.  i occasionally color my hair to help thin it and keep the white at bay for the moment. my hair is longer now and still very thick. i have a love of hair that borders on a fetish. the longer the better. apparently the color of my hair is a very interesting topic for the moment. books: i have a deep love of just about anything by isaac asimov. robert heinlein is also up there. i have been reading science fictionsince 7 years old. ray bradbury is really good too. neil gaiman is probably my favorite now. i think i am starting to like terry brooks as well. i have a lot of books about the stuff that i am interested in and am trying to find a way to compose my own. philip pullman is on the list too. i just realized that c. s. lewis is also big on my reading list. i have a large collection of supernatural beings in my collection. yes even some old d&d novels are in there. everyone has their fluff to read. friday by robert a. heinlein, aisling by louise cooper, lion's blood by steven barnes, harry potter, dracula by bram stoker(unabridged), beowulf, and more to name later. the black dagger brotherhood books by j. r. ward are interesting.  movies: beowulf adapted by gaiman. the lord of the rings:rotk the extended version filled my nights with pondering.  music: i have always liked what is now called ""classic rock"" though when it comes to playing or composing i tend to be more blues oriented. i have a thing for percussion of all types. largely depends on what my mood is at the time. i have over a thousand cd's in my collection. i have just about every kind of music. what is there not to like save for the stuff that puts people down. as long as it takes you someplace it is very welcome. of late though i am starting to drift back into a darker mood to the music i listen to for the moment. my youtube account has a good representation. music means a lot to me. angus young, henry rollins, danny elfman, jimi hendrix, colin hays, joan jett, robert johnson, tenacious d, concrete blonde, howard jones, metallica, kmfdm, lycia, estampie, rob zombie comprise the beginning of the list of music in my head. at least for today. i really like all kinds of music. i don't think music has ever left my life and for that i am very thankful. it has the capacity to change the coldest heart and calm the troubled mind. i felt it early on in my soul. i belive music is a language to itself. i would defend music and its right to be played at any cost.  shows: i am into british science fiction shows. firefly. dr. who. red dwarf. hex. supernatural. smallville. painkiller jane. have not watched much else but am enjoying a lot of series on netflix very much. i had a weak spot for forever knight and special unit 2 when they first aired.  food: the one thing that i cannot even stomach is the combination of broccoli and cheese together. just about anything else will work. my weakness is all things made from blueberries. i just cannot pass up anything with them in it. the biggest bummer is when they took the blueberry newtons off the market. i found a substitute but they are not the same. and to think that blueberries are good for you. connections. love. music. serene moments. laughter. the universe. experience has shown me that there is no limit to the repercussion that can happen based on a single action. it takes but a moment to connect in a meaningful way.  it is as if by someone actually reading all of this rambling that they could glean something of my personality and find it within them to craft some witty response to what my mind was going through at this time. when all is said and done this sojourn that is life will be what it wanted to be. i am a man of many things.  it also seems very odd to me to consider writing a response to something that obviously by its phrasing at this writing wants a single response and not necessarily a discourse. yet for some reason rather than attempt to write a test for this site i continue to fill in characters to bring this character total to an acceptable place.  tell me what you

[insert comical drum snare here.]  ...keeping my cool in tense situations. i'm really good at keeping discussions from turning into arguments, even if the other person is irritable. i'm almost always able to help settle disputes between two friends who are too mad at each other to talk otherwise. likewise, you'll find that no matter how much you scream at me, i'll never yell back. i have been known to cry though.  ...talking about what's going on inside my head. this is an especially practical skill for me because apparently my facial expressions can occasionally be very difficult to decipher. i'm also really good at getting other people to talk about what's going on inside their own heads; i'm very empathic.  i love to sing and dance. i'm pretty good at both, but my singing is definitely better. i really enjoy going out dancing at clubs, so long as they're not too crowded.  i'm really good at starting conversations, and at breathing new life in to group discussions once they get stale. i'm kind of bad at participating in group discussions though, although i try. i'm strange like this. relatedly, i'm also rather fearless when it comes to talking to strangers, especially if they're cute.  i enjoy paying attention to politics and occasionally getting pissed off at our government. i read (and very occasionally watch) the news habitually, on a near daily basis.  i have never lost a best two-out-of-three thumb wrestling match. i used to challenge everyone i met, but winning got boring (this was back in my teens). if you think you can beat me, i'll welcome your contest, but i am totally, 100% serious about never having lost before.  and cooking! not something i do every day, but it's certainly my most practical skill. i know my way around a spice rack pretty darn well, or at least i like to think so. usually when i cook, it's a soup or sauce, and it's almost always vegetarian or vegan. i'm not a vegetarian myself, just health conscious. usually, the very first thing that people notice about me is that i'm wearing rather femme makeup. if my hair is down, i receive frequent remarks about how long and beautiful it is.  besides the physical, people also notice that i have a lot of courage, often peculiarly accompanied by a difficulty in speaking up. i find it incredibly easy to get on stage, or to just walk up to strangers and attempt to start conversations, but i don't always have the easiest time chiming in on ongoing conversations. just one of the many ways in which i am an oddball. i feel that i should tell you that even though i'm cooperating, and making these lists, this is the one section that i always skip over when i first read somebody's profile. i'm 100% confident that i can be friends, or even lovers, with somebody who has different tastes in entertainment, sources of knowledge, and cuisine than i do.  (books) hitchhiker's guide trilogy, celestine prophecy, am i really here?, catcher in the rye, mysterious stranger, brave new world  (movies) moulin rouge, the matrix, harold and maude, benny and joone, fantastic planet, headwig and the angry inch, anything directed by danny boyle or steven spielberg, and i'm always down for a documentary  (music) bnl, atmosphere, all good funk alliance, the handsome boy modeling school, hilltop hoods, mgmt, gnarls barkley  (food) pesto, pizza, golden delicious apples, most things indian, and cheese. please note that while i do occasionally eat meat, no meat is on this list.  (radio/podcast) this american life, a prairie home companion  (tv) 30 rock, futurama, south park, this american life (tal was short lived on tv, but episode one of season two is my favorite episode of anything, ever. it's on netflix, but i must warn you that you might cry and laugh at the same time.), the daily show, nova first and foremost: good friends (seriously, i'd die)  long distance communication (either a phone, internet access, or even just good old fashioned letter writing; i'd feel lost without at least one of these things)  nature (as in going out and experiencing it)  a thesaurus (a dictionary almost made the list, but i use a thesaurus far more often.)  love/affection/cuddles  learning the world. the human race is in more trouble than we've ever been in before. fascism is vast in asia, africa, and south america, and is spreading in the western world much faster than most people realize, or would like to admit. the midwest, where i come from, is in a horrid police state; having escaped it by moving to san francisco is a welcome relief.  racism, classism, sexism, a bunch of other negative -isms, and how i might be able to help rid the world of them.  relationships, whether they be platonic, sexual, or romantic. i try to stay friends with almost everyone i know, which is often difficult. my mind is full of drama.  sex. i think about sex a lot, and not just me having sex. i think about the power that sex has over most people, about how not nearly enough is done to educate youth about everything around sex, and about how so many adults don't know everything they should about it either. i ponder how the relationships i have with my friends would be different if we had slept together at some point, or if we'd never slept together. but also, my sex drive is rather insatiable, so i do think about myself and sex a lot. i don't like the way okc phrased this question because i'm often working on friday nights. instead of telling you what i do on fridays, i'll just tell you what i like to do in my free time.  seeing as how i just moved to the bay area, and am developing a new life, this section should be considered a work in progress. especially because the bulk of it has carried over from my life in cincinnati.  i like to spend most of my time off with other people; i crave social interaction, and only like to spend two or three nights alone each month. i love to go out, and meet new people. i'm down for a noisy bar or club, but only if it also involves dancing. if there's no dancing, i prefer a quieter place where people can hear each other when they talk. but really, i love to dance in clubs, especially if i can find a good partner.  even though i like to go out and about, many of my evenings are spent in friends' living rooms. there, we converse, drink, smoke, watch a movie, play a game, and/or make art. not that we necessarily ever do all these things at the same time, but i think you get the point. so i suppose this section is for confessions? well okay...  i have a lot of trouble relating to cis-males. the kinder, gentler, less sporty ones make this easier though.  i really enjoy looking and acting feminine, except for the occasionally feeling shunned by society part. moving to the bay has made this a lot easier on me though :-d  i have a lot of love in me to give, and that's no exaggeration.  nothing makes me swoon more than when a special somebody leans in, and kisses me first. it's only happened twice in my entire life, so i tend to really cherish the moment when it happens.  i really like sex (i'm actually rather insatiable), but i only very rarely fantasize about having sex with people who i've never been sexually active with. instead, my fantasies tend to revolve around flirting, and that elusive first kiss that i mentioned above.  yes, i'm this weird even when there's nobody around to see it. [please note that there is no need for you to meet any of the following criteria in order to message me.]  ...if you're searching for a friend you can talk to about anything, during all hours of the day with few exceptions. this isn't something i'm looking for from a lover, necessarily, but i am looking for it from somebody.  ...if you'll have the courage to kiss me first. it's only happened twice in my entire life, and i'm generally rather tired of always having to make the first move.  ...if you live somewhere around the bay, and want to be my friend.  ...if we match 90% or higher in the friend category, no matter where you live.  ...if you are intergender, genderqueer, genderfluid, or identify as any other kind of non-binary gender. i tend to get along with these people the very best.  ...if you'll let me be the little/inside spoon, despite the fact that i'm six feet tall.  ...if you're new in the bay, and want suggestions for things to do in the queer or kinky communities. i have gained a lot of incite in to both since i've been here. we don't even have to hang out; i will willingly volunteer this information to you over email because i sympathize with being new in town.  i'm interested in people who would rather go on a picnic, on a warm, sunny day with their best friend, than receive the most expensive gift in the world. you can not buy happiness."

(what's the point? even if you mange to seduce a guy by misrepresenting your appearance when you meet in person he will immediately realize it and all your effort will have been for nothing. if you are a full figured woman there are people who are into that; by misrepresenting yourself you attract people who won't be attracted to you while repulsing those who would.)

and when does the fun stuff start?  2011 was a year of life changes for me, and i've ended up in a completely different position than i expected. it hasn't been easy, but i've learned a lot about myself and i'm looking forward to the future.  besides that, i'm usually concentrating on school and working out. i'm a 24 hour fitness member and i love it. i kick box, swim, dance, run, anything that gets my heart rate up. it's a great escape from school stress. that, and i've made a promise to myself that the only drug i'll ever allow myself to be addicted to is adrenaline. i figure it's gotta be more fun than being strung out on heroin. eh, friday nights are usually all or nothing situations. i can go for the night on the town...dancing, heading to a ball game, movies, partying, hitting up the bar, or just hanging out with friends. i'm pretty open-minded about stuff and love having adventures.  at the same time, i'm sometimes down for saying no to my friends in favor of the night in with family or alone...comfy pajamas and a good book, kickback watching sports and have a couple of beers, or netflix. i'm a hanson fan. feel free to make fun of me for it.  otherwise, i'm pretty open with most people...hiding things just requires too much effort. i told you...basically amazing, right?

""why is he in a suit?"" i make it a point to dress nicely in social occasions, when i can afford to. i am keenly aware that i'm not entirely pleasant to look at, so the least i can do is make the effort to dress nicer than i look. also, i dislike wearing denim, and you will never find me in a pair of jeans.  ""holy crap what's wrong with your fingers."" only slightly exaggerated, but my fingers do draw some degree of attention. there is hair growing on the first set of metacarpals beyond the knuckles, and this seems to shock people when they notice them. i am... actually somewhat embarrassed by this fact, but i make no effort to shave my fingers. i'll admit, i'm not a very literary person. the words ""have you read?"" are lost on me more often than not. i've read more comics than actual novels, but there are a scant few that i've actually enjoyed. i'll list them below in no particular order.  tales from underground (dostoyevsky) hellsing (manga, kouta hirano) the book of five rings (musashi) sin city (comic, frank miller)  i don't watch a lot of tv, and in the rare cases that i do, my favorite shows are usually cancelled.  better off ted (cancelled) big bang theory how i met your mother firefly ('nuff said) breaking in (cancelled, then uncancelled?) wonderfalls (cancelled)  i do watch quite a bit of anime, although i only choose to separate them from the tv segment because i can't actually watch them broadcast on tv. this is in no particular order:  queen's blade (seasons 1 & 2, ovas and rebellion) black rock shooter (2012 anime) steins;gate baccano! strike witches hellsing ultimate (ova) trigun the slayers sayonara zetsubou sensei (any and all of them, i can't keep track anymore) fate/stay night high school of the dead the idolm@ster last exile (still haven't seen the new series, looking to find it) panty & stocking with garterbelt tengen toppa gurren lagann nichijou persona 4: the animation carnival phantasm (ova)  i'm not particularly big on movies either, but i do watch quite a bit and i have a few eclectic favorites.  akira (anime, film) steamboy (anime, film) summer wars (anime, film) ghost in the shell 1 & 2 (anime, film) millennium actress (anime, film) fearless (jet li) fong sai yuk series (jet li, hong kong) once upon a time in china series (jet li, hong kong) samurai fiction (japanese) scott pilgrim vs the world  i've been somewhat disconnected from mainstream music, for various reasons. i usually enjoy soundtracks from my favorite games or anime, but i also enjoy classic rock. here's another completely scrambled list of my favorite bands and composers:  shoji meguro (shin megami tensei series, persona series) daisuke ishiwatari (guilty gear series, blazblue series) zun (touhou series) crow's claw (indie circle, japan) demetori (indie circle, japan) queen ac/dc van halen  food... oh boy. i don't have any particular favorites, but i do enjoy just about everything with rare few exceptions. if i had to pick out favorites, i'd have to go with the rich, succulent flavor of gourmet seafood, or the powerful, filling flavor of good barbecue.  and because video games are a large part of my hobbies, here's a rough list of my favorites below:  league of legends (pc, strategy) skullgirls (multi, 2d fighting game) blazblue series (ps3/360, 2d fighting) soul calibur series (multi, 3d fighting) street fighter x tekken (ps3/360, 2d fighting) dead or alive series (multi, 3d fighting) arcana heart series (ps2-ps3, 2d fighting) king of fighters series (multi, 2d fighting) darkstalkers series (multi, 2d fighting) rival schools series (multi, 3d fighting) tales of vesperia (360, jrpg) nier (ps3/360, action jrpg) shin megami tensei: nocturne (ps2, jrpg) persona 3: fes (ps2, jrpg) persona 4 (ps2, jrpg) catherine (ps3/360, puzzle horror rpg) .hack series (ps2, jrpg) final fantasy tactics (ps1/psp, tactical jrpg) disgaea series (ps2-ps3, tactical jrpg) sengoku basara: samurai heroes (ps3, action adventure) devil may cry series (ps2-ps3, action adventure) bayonetta (ps3/360, action adventure) saint's row: the third (multi, action shooter) touhou series (pc, danmaku shooter) monster hunter series (multi, action) team fortress 2 (pc, fps, and likely the only fps on this list) portal series (multi, first-person puzzle) diablo iii (pc, adventure-rpg) katawa shoujo (pc, visual novel) dc universe online (pc, action-mmo) phantasy star online (dreamcast, action-mmo) music silence disturbs me. music moves me. the absence of motion is unsettling.  fiction i'd normally single out 'anime' or 'games', but the truth is i just want to have some fiction to fall into. it doesn't have to be a grand sweeping epic, it can be simple and fun; it doesn't matter, as long as there's something to experience and explore.  companionship i don't consider myself extroverted, nor do i consider myself introverted. all the same, being all alone is a frightening, frightening thought. i often get depressed when there's absolutely no one in the house except myself.  art this might file under the 'fiction' section, but it has more to do with my own ability to create art rather than to experience it. as mentioned above, i love to create. it comes together with the other entries above: i love to absorb fiction, coalesce them into thought, create art, and share my creations with people.  humor i don't consider myself a dreadfully serious person. i love to laugh, because... well, who doesn't?  erotica it's worth mentioning a second time that i am notoriously perverted. i'm proud of my sexuality and make no secret of it. call me shallow if you must, but i idolize beauty and i don't hold myself back with some false sense of 'maturity'. if i think it's sexy, i'll call it as i see it. no eloquent paragraphs this time, my thoughts aren't so clear-cut to me that i can write essays about them.  much of my head is buried in games and fiction. if i'm not pondering story ideas or ludicrously sexy character designs, i'm probably thinking about game design, or some way to merge the two into a cohesive narrative experience. a lot of time is spent thinking about how to bridge the gap between western game design tropes and eastern game design tropes to make one multicultural awesome mega-game. the few times i'm not thinking of games or stories, i'm probably thinking about the future, which isn't always a positive experience. if nothing else, i also spend time thinking of how to make more money, or of my next self-appointed project, assuming i'm not already on one. drawing or gaming. the two activities comprise most of my daily life, so this isn't really exclusive to friday nights. back in high school, i used to drape my hair over one eye. i wasn't emo or anything, i just wanted to have cool anime hair. then emo people stole it from me, so i had to resort to more reasonable hair. as a result, my left eye is actually more nearsighted than my right eye. no joke, it's on my prescription.  fun fact: you actually can see through a curtain of hair over your eyes. the hair is close enough such that you can see between the strands. you can tolerate frequent rants on western gaming culture vs eastern gaming culture, liberal distortion of the english language, or know what fratmog's means (or if you don't, be willing to learn!).  hell, message me anyway. i'm sure i've got something gentlemanly and/or strange to say in reply!"

is it therefore impossible to fail at quixotic endeavor? or perhaps that the only way to fail at it is to not try?  also, how to simplify my life. getting rid of some of my amazing and eclectic collection of junk (but i love it! all of it! but it takes up so much space. and takes up time when i rediscover something that captures my interest)  and, how to get out of town more often. it's such a wonderful reset.  oh, and how the world would be different if (saint) paul hadn't won that legendary intellectuo-religious barroom brawl with (saint) peter.  and why there are no courses in ""conversational latin"".  and how it is that okcupid determined that i am ""less rational"".  more seriously, wondering if i can be in a long-term monogamous relationship. i've never gone over a year in a monogamous relationship, whereas i've gone nine years in an open relationship. i think the jury's still out on that one. dancing to balkan music (not doing enough of that yet) or catching up on sleep.  edit: my longstanding diagnosis of ""insomnia"" has been changed to ""some kind of circadian rhythm disorder"", so i am ordered to have no excitement at nighttime. also to wake up early no matter what time i got to sleep the night before. *sigh* so my typical friday night activities (eh, pretty much like the rest of the week) center around playing guitar (new edit: not playing guitar anymore, got tennis elbow from it !ftw?! (even newer edit: taken up guitar again; screw what the sports med doc said!)) or watching documentaries until i fall asleep. i have learned soooooooo much about mid east, circum mediterranean, and european history in the last several months. it's fascinating, but kind of sad.  and here i sit typing this at 2:42am. i'm usually very shy with people until i get to know them. but i don't necessarily act like it.  i turn on subtitles on almost everything i watch (an ex said i have auditory processing disorder; i'd be hard-pressed to refute that).  i am horribly, chronically, unpunctual. that's probably why i ride a motorcycle, so i don't have to make anyone else late. if unpunctuality bothers you, now is the time to click the ""back"" button on your browser.  i'm also horribly, chronically, disorganized. like, i have absolutely no sense of spatial organization. actually, i think i have negative sense of spatial organization. if that bothers you, use that ""back"" button. otoh, if you're the kind of person who compulsively organizes other peoples houses, i'm already in love with you. but please don't feel that that is any sort of requirement, i kind of like my disorganized mess, except when i can't find things, or when it bothers other people.  i listen to showtunes. not much, mostly some stuff from the 70s and 80s.  i will not father children. i've had that seen to.  i'm currently overweight. this changes somewhat frequently, but my current lack of a gym membership has pushed it in the upward direction. i'm told i carry it well, i guess the height and large frame help. and i guess it's not really private since it's visibly obvious.  i don't have any stds, but i do have oral hsv1, aka oral herpes, aka cold sores. so far as i know, none of my exes have contracted it from me, on any parts of their bodies ;) i usually know at least a day in advance when a cold sore is coming on, and medicate and act appropriately. i'm putting that out there in advance, so that, should it ever come to that, you can decide where you want my lips to go.  i'm lying about my age on okc, i'm 5 years older than my stated profile age. it's dishonest, i know, and i hate dishonesty, but okc's matching algorithms gave me a much lower percentage of interesting matches when i used my real age. so, there's my attempt to remedy the dishonesty.  i guess none of this is really private anymore :) 1) you are, as of yet, insufficiently frightened. or,  2) redacted.  3) you have an answer to my questions about quixotic endeavor. or,  4) you prefer prokofiev's ""romeo and juliet"" to tchaikovsky's ""romeo and juliet"". berlioz is also acceptable. or,  5) you adore edward abbey, have a four wheel drive vehicle (or two horses), and want to take me camping. or,  6) there is no reason #6.  7) you can teach me proper guitar technique, so i don't get tennis elbow from it again. and we can play duets!. or,  8) you have an extra ticket to the symphony, and need a date :) or,  9) you have the 5 hour serbian television version of kusturica's ""underground"". or,  10) you have a lot of money to blow and want to take me to petra. i know enough arabic now to get a hotel room, taxi, and food, so i could be like a translator. pretty please?  11) you're an outdoorsy tomboyish girl with some indoorsy bookwormish tendencies, a wickedly irreverent sense of humor, and a certain disdain for conventional society. and you're not afraid of motorcycles.  12) #11 is serious. i mean, they're all serious, if rather joking in that i don't really expect anyone to meet more than one or two of them, and none of them are that important (well, i suppose #1 is). but if you meet #11 and #1, i want to meet you. any of the others would be pleasantly surprising bonuses."

even if i think the world's deterministic, at least i can use my power to determine that individuals feel self-empowered to take actions at their own will. i'm probably happiest if i'm in a tent. backpacking the coast in the winter and the sierra nevada in the summer. bike touring and secret camping is great fun. camping out to do some climbing is a new favorite. i've got lots of amazing ""trip friends"" but could always use more. even in the city i might be out for night hike, bike ride, or other urban adventure.  if i'm in the city maybe having friends over for dinner or out to check out some gallery or event. although when it's a big scene, it's not my thing. i try to be open minded, but i'm still awfully close minded to hipsters, forgive me if you self-identify. honestly, i hate people trying to be cool, can't stand prevention, and would rather be excluded from exclusion. i'd love to see some more live music. or maybe i am sitting home alone geeking on my latest education theory book or baking something for tomorrow's adventure. i remember when i was a freshman in college people asked me what type of music i listened to and what my favorite band was. i remember being really embarrassed because i didn't have a good response. i listen to music sometimes and i enjoy it. it just isn't my thing and i don't spend time on it. i told myself that i should start listening to more music and that i should refine my musical taste. a couple years ago i realized how stupid this was to change myself to impress others. now i just tell people the truth. i care deeply about social justice, so if you are not unsettled about the current state of affairs and have no interest in talking about it, it's probably not going to work out.  i spend a vast majority of my free time doing active things outdoors. it's sounds completely legit to say, ""it's cool if we don't have the same hobbies"". in theory i completely agree. but yeah i'm not looking to give up a weekend of backpacking for sunday football with the bros.  i guess i'm still a bit interested in meeting people as friends but i think i'm ready to find something real."

 favorite quote #2 (from thoreau): ""we are happy in proportion to the things we can do without."" everything too much.  what? you want examples? ok, for starters:  - how to leave this planet better than i found it  - how to feed my goals more than my fears  - where to travel next  - how to invent a better kabob skewer (but who *doesn't* spend a lot of time thinking about that?!?)  also: mindfulness, evolution, sudoku, urban planning, behavioral finance, sleep, maps, democracy, fitness, impermanence, architecture, artificial intelligence, nutrition, neuroplasticity, sustainability, ... often at home reading or at the gym. sometimes i'm out with friends -- usually at dinner and/or a movie. since i don't have a fixed work schedule, my fridays are generally not much different than other days. a story that begins in my childhood (don't they all?): i was born with a vision problem that caused my eyes to cross and made me see double. i had eye surgery when i was 18 and it's much better now, but i still don't make eye contact with people quite as much as i should. it has nothing to do with being shifty or disingenuous -- if you knew me, you'd know how far from the truth that is. i just feel self-conscious when holding someone's gaze for a long time. it's something that i'm still working on. your baggage fits in the overhead compartment or under the seat in front of you. ;-) [actually, i've been rethinking this whole baggage thing in light of a friend's recent facebook quote: ""everyone comes with baggage. find someone who loves you enough to help you unpack."" to which i replied: ""yep! or at least someone whose baggage goes well with yours.""]  but, seriously here are a few adjectives that describe me. we might be a good match if they describe you too: kind, honest, dependable, open-minded, drama-free, imperfect (but improving), interesting, and interested.  of course, like any good playmate, i have lots of other turn-ons and turn-offs, but they're mostly negotiable. i don't need (or even want) my partner to be exactly like me, but i am looking for a woman who's facing in the same general direction and who can appreciate our differences as much as our similarities.  and if you like pia coladas..."

(a) i used to read a lot of sci-fi/fantasy books back in grade school, particularly william gibson and neal stephenson. some more recent favorites are david sedaris, jack kerouac, tom robbins and hunter s. thompson.   (b) my favorite movies are the ones that can really make me think, but there's nothing wrong with a good comedy either. in particular: fight club, trainspotting, the big lebowski, office space and a clockwork orange. i don't go out to see movies very often but love smaller local places like the castro theater.

my buddy did it.... i respect him.  and, the thing is, i proabably eat at least a few burritos a week. i could probably eat mexican every day.  and, i think, food is probably, in a sense, a deal-breaker for me.. i mean, if you're like a super picky eater or a vegan or vegetarian.. it's probably gonna be a challenge for us to make things work. i really love eating all kinds of food. i totally respect vegetarians, but it ain't my thing right now.  i do eat out a lot. there's so much great food in this city, it's hard not to. most of it is pretty reasonably priced. but i think i should cook more. and i'm trying to make that happen.  as far as movies go, i like stuff that's original, and idiosyncratic. i like a lot of independent films. but i just saw iron man 2 and really liked it, so... music, definitely. makes me happy.  physical excercise. mostly takes the form of surfing these days.  my friends; life would be pretty lonely without them.  good clothes, and cool shoes.. i've been into clarks lately. and i love vans and converse.  coffeeeeeee. yeah i love coffee, the leaded stuff. usually black, maybe a little sugar. martha & bros is probably my fav in the city. blue bottle's a little overrated, but still good. and i've only had philz once. pretty tasty.  a bit of peace and quiet now and then is essential too.  good food. mmmmm. i love to eat. myself. but i'm working on it ;-)  surfing too. and whether a job is just a way to finance your true passion. or if it's supposed to be your passion.  and what comes next. usually pretty wiped out from a full week of work. but i still often make it to dinner and sometimes a movie with friends. saturday night is more my kinda night though. honestly, these days, i like the day more than the night :-)  i used to go to the urban dharma meditation a lot. but i've been busy with another commitment. i'd like to get back to it. i think meditation is a valuable practice. i go to therapy.  and i've got a colorful past, i.e., a lot of life experience. it makes me interesting. you're kind, intelligent, compassionate, and growing emotionally and spiritually. you want something serious, and you realize that long term relationships take work. you're good at communication... or getting better (like me). and you appreciate culture, but you're not a total snob about it. like i mentioned, i've eaten a lot of fried things on sticks. and i'd do it again!  it would help if you like sports ;-) or, you're at least tolerant of them. and you gotta like the outdoors!  and you're not too busy to date either...  oh yeah, and bonus points if you surf. or you want to learn."

(that, and pickles) i like cooking and don't do it nearly enough. i also am working on a line of gourmet popcorn spices. beta-tasters wanted. seriously. i truly believe we can all survive quite well without 95% of the things we think we ""need"". one thing i could definitely do without? cheesy icebreaker questions that try to distill someone down to six things. read the rest of the profile if you really want to get an idea of what i'm about. or better yet - have an actual conversation with me.  ok, i'll play a little bit. contact lenses. i have worse eyesight than anyone you know. the doctor once told me ""you are blind out of one eye, and can't see out the other"", and that was before developing a corneal ulcer in one eye and losing further eyesight. it makes for good stories - but with my contacts i'm pretty high functioning. i'm socially conscious and very politically active, with a big focus on environmental issues. thus, i spend a lot of time thinking about ecology, politics, economics, social change and the like. if you can have an intelligent conversation about climate change, energy, globalization, social movements, feminism, politics, justice, economics or capitalism - we'll get along swell.  if not, i like talking about the simpsons and matt damon too. and i'm trying to focus on climbing, hiking, snowboarding, travelling, and camping more - so thinking about trips out of town seem to be a passion of late. i'd say equal parts out of town in nature, mellow night watching a movie or reading a book, and the occasional all-night party mayhem.  usual spots i might be on a friday? a friends house/dinner party, my backyard in a hammock with a fire going. yosemite, tahoe, dolores park, benders, lanesplitter, shotwells, kilowatt, zeitgeist, beer revolution, the trappist, or souley vegan with a pile of friends. riding my bicycle somewhere fun. riding my motorcycle somewhere further away and fun. quite possibly at the climbing gym. i just moved to oakland (from the mission), so still sorting out my new spots.  i don't have much of a routine - and generally like spontaneity. fridays aren't necessarily much different than tuesdays for me. i know all the words to humpty dance, it takes two, and a bunch of other 90's hip hop (fresh prince, bel biv devoe, kriss kross, young mc and many more).  these aren't really private things - but might be things worth getting out in the open right away:  * i don't dance. well, i don't go ""clubbing"". i love music, you will totally catch me tapping a foot, shaking a hip, or air drumming - but you likely won't drag me out to a pop club. *i'm not going to be your baby daddy. i'm open to the idea of adoption at some point, but i've had a vasectomy. now that i've hit my 30's - i find that kills half the potential dating/partner pool right off the bat.  wow. that's 3 things. i'm clearly not all that private. i'm quite open-minded and recognize that there are lots of interesting people in the world that have unique and amazing qualities. i generally try to not meet/date people with any sort of expectations - i've been in poly and monogamous relationships, friends are great and lovers are great, and trying to squeeze everyone and everything into a predetermined box can often take the fun out of life.  i'm definitely yearning for a partner and best friend - someone to share the adventures of life with, make amazing memories with, and get to know inside and out. that said, i'm not so hell-bent on that desire that i'm going to pass up meeting and hanging out with awesome people that might not be exactly on that same path.  generally - i like women who appreciate the outdoors and the city, like getting dirty and camping but also have some urbanite in them. i really tend to like people who can defy aesthetic or cultural stereotypes. like the girl-next-door-innocent-looking-types who are anything but. or people who don't feel a need to look like marilyn manson even though they might secretly love metal. (which i don't, and i do - though, not marilyn manson so much). or you recognize that chacos and jeans are just as sexy as a dress and boots.  you don't need to be vegan, or an activist - but you should give a shit about the world around you, and be on the progressive side of the spectrum. i like people who are positive and see beauty all around - but also see the ugly stuff and strive to make it better. (but without getting those crazy hippie/stoner eyes, or getting into vivid detail about my shakras or anything) that can mean a lot of things - but you know who you are."

if you have a theory, please let me know. i am going to be keeping track. some time, i'll post the results. food that tickles the tastebuds long conversations about nothing in particular interesting-looking people pretty places to meander good things to read sex in any or all of its lovely multivariant forms  i've been learning a lot about what i can't do without, as my house burned down last march and destroyed most of what i owned. it's still awfully weird to think about most of my possessions in the past tense. what barriers i have put up that are now getting in my way, and how to overcome those barriers.  how to build a sustainable floating island - i kinda want to start my own country, and make it work by acquiring resources in less environmentally damaging ways than we do now.  how we can improve the world and how to convince others that it needs improving in the ways that i think it does.  building things - furniture is my usual medium. cooking things. also, fermenting things. i think that i'm going to start making mead again. i love the stuff and i miss having it around.  how amazing the world is. cooking something, surfing the web or the tv, and/or thinking about what i should really be doing. my life has gotten too staid lately, that's part of why i'm here. getting my nipples pierced was one of my best rash decisions ever. the rings have proven to be really fun for everyone involved. you like to cuddle, you are interested in deep conversations, you like to try new food or you think that i'm cute. :-).  you should also message me if you have an opinion about why everyone mentions cheese in their profiles. i want to get lots of cheese related responses so that i can post the results."

people who haven't seen me for 20 years hear me laugh and come and find me...i can never be too anonymous. although i have learned how to become invisible when i want, and sometimes that's often. ahhhhhhhhhhh...i love to read :) i grew up eating books for breakfast lunch and dinner, no tv, which gave me a lot. i really cultivated my curiosity and my imagination. i have been reading non fiction rather relentlessly for the last 10 years...and this last year i have been being drawn back to the marvels of story telling again. authors like isabel allende and natalie goldberg (natalie wrote ""writing down the bones"" amongst many greats) really float my boat. i love authors who grab your heart and soul and pull you into feeling each moment they are weaving...i also loved ""eat pray love"". po bronson's book ""what should i do with my life"" was riveting and real. i love to hear people's stories.  movies...there are many that have moved me. i need to think about this one and come back to it. i want to share something that has impacted me recently.  music, oh how i love music. how it reaches inside and moves one. i love music that opens me, music like peter gabriel's ""passion"". i love music with rhythm, funk, beat, music that makes me want to move move move. think kid beyond, a beatboxer from heaven :) all kinds come to mind, stevie wonder, michael jackson, prince...i used to go to the little hole in the wall blues clubs in oakland starting when i was around 16. lately i started listening to classical a lot again, as well as rock and roll :) i love to sing too. and play drums.  the bottom line...i love music !!!!  and food. well, who doesn't love food ? i am particularly crazy about vegetables...fresh, luscious, organic vegetables make my mouth water and hummmmm...  i love feeling fabulous so i love putting food inside that makes me feel fabulous !!! i used to eat all raw for many years, and these days i am eating more of a balance between cooked food and raw. i love cafe gratitude's caesar salad. just thinking about it right now makes my mouth water. i eat organic whenever i can. i eat vegan. and i have been in relationship with men who eat meat, just so you know.  i decided when i was 6 years old that i would not drink soda, coffee, alcohol or smoke cigarettes, and that decision has served me well to climb many mountains, both metaphorically, as well as physically...is it legal to feel this good ?

 i think about culture and consciousness a lot, values, how and why we are the way we are. i think about how i am growing and how i want to continue to grow, blossom, expand and develop. i think about how to to be the very best i can - living as the highest version of myself - and about how to be true to my deeper heart on this crazy spinning ball...in these crazy speeding times. i think about how to make a living spreading the boogie love movement. creating a way to unify people all over the world and remind us how it feels to connect and care rather than disconnect and be numb.  and you ? this varies a lot...some of the possibilities are...taking a night hike alone or with a friend, watching a movie, reading, writing, sitting with a dear friend and sharing a moment of ourselves, going out to an event with friends (i am connected to many communities), dancing...i love love love dancing. parking lots are some of my favorite places to dance. i look for ways to celebrate and engage in being alive from my heart and spirit. i long to travel. my whole being yearns for expansion and exploration. my secret wish ? i would love to meet someone who loves to travel and wants to travel and have an extraordinary traveling companion...it could be a platonic thing, it could be a creative feast muse thing, it could be...well, the sky's the limit :) i went to portugal last year and fell in love with the city of light ! and the year before i went to turkey and worked on a project there...and i want to go back !!!!! have you been ?
